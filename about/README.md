# About the site

The site provides a set of themed essays about Kent, a county in South East England.  Kent has a rich history and provided inspiration for a number of writers and artists including Charles Dickens, who is featured in the early essays available on the site. Framed by the idea of ‘writers and their times’, the project is researching historic, literary and geographical records to create an interactive experience seen through multi-disciplinary lenses. This approach contextualises literature and textual records of historic events through an emphasis on the material conditions in which they were produced and circulated. But rather than simply recreating a historic experience, the research aims to problematise the ways in which we interpret and represent the past. What do we think we know about the history of local landscapes? How do conflicting perspectives and gaps in the record remind us that representation is always selective and that history is just that – a story we tell to others and ourselves? As the map grows so too will the capacity for making unforeseen connections. While the project inevitably reflects the interests of the research team, it is highly collaborative and is not designed to showcase or privilege any one argument over another. Instead it will help you find your own answers to questions you haven’t thought of yet.

The project team hosts an annual [Kent Digital Maps Symposium](https://www.canterbury.ac.uk/arts-and-humanities/school-of-humanities/research/victorian-women-writers/seminar-series/kent-maps-online-symposium.aspx) and has their own YouTube channel: [Kent Maps Online](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAIbFfzsJzaeYwVNuCeF50w).

He takes us through the maps of the human and physical impact of two world wars and the accelerating economic pressures of the late 20th century upon the historic and spiritual character of England’s most ancient cathedral city. A section to be completed offsets the 20th century urban and commercial expansion of the city by the successful preservation of recreational areas and the green spaces along the banks and islands of the river Sour as it divides through the city.
