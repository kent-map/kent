Come on, let’s go and eat mulberries.    
Please, come to the garden with me.    
Take my hand, breakfast is waiting   
Underneath leaves on that tree.    
<br><br>
Stand with me here on the threshold,   
Look, love, over there are the leaves.   
Heart-shaped with all a heart’s plumpness   
And pointed for all a heart grieves.

From calm cool and darkness inside   
We’ll cross into blazing gold light.   
Sunrise is melting the shadows,   
Its fingers are closing the night.   
<br><br>
Down the steps into the garden,    
Bare feet on dew-twinkling grass.   
Savour the smell of the morning,   
With warmth it will dissipate fast.

Overhead there’s a living mosaic   
Of sunlight, green leaves, sky’s blue band.   
See those red cones?  They are the fruits.   
Reach to the branch with your hand.   
<br><br>
Don’t mind the twigs beneath on the ground.   
They are thornless and do feet no harm.   
Now, pick your fruit.  Be careful, mind,   
The juices will run down your arm.   
<br><br>
What do you think?  Did you like that?   
Was it luscious and fragrant and sweet?   
Is an open-air mulberry breakfast   
The ultimate hedonist’s treat?
