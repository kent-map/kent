‘But what’s wrong with this city? Why the long face on the cathedral clock? Whose shadow darkens the sundial?
I check my dates. Thirteen decades have passed. The removal of mourning rings may require soap if Rochester ever recovers (which looks doubtful).  
<br>
‘It’s hard to rationalise what I’m seeing today on my afternoon stroll: flint walling, personalised number plates, a QPR sticker in a bedroom window. Spindrift, Winday Bay, Lindisfarne – houses which clamber on top of one another like mad-eyed toads in a jar.’ _All the Devils are Here_, 2002.

The word mystery comes to mind when approaching Seabrook and his work - a fitting word, given the author’s obsession with the local lore and hidden historical disjecta membra of Kent’s coastal towns, and intertextually apposite given Seabrook’s extended analysis of Drood in _All the Devils Are Here_ (2002), where he offers [Richard Dadd](/19c/19c-dadd-biography) (he of the unfinished Fairy Feller’s Master-Stroke) as the inspiration for [Dickens’s](/dickens/dickens-biography) eponym, whose cruel parricide, Seabrook opines, served as fodder for the (probable) fate of the forever-deferred [Edwin](/dickens/edwin-drood-curated-walk).

The Wiki page, the flyleaf to the Granta edition of Devils: same story.  Found dead in his Canterbury lodgings, ‘there is unconfirmed speculation that Seabrook was murdered’; his writings, we learn, are ‘mysterious, incandescent’, and, life again mirroring art, Seabrook’s own literary fate matching that of the many scattered scraps he pursues in _Devils_, they ‘are now considered lost’.   
Fragments shored against ruins.

_Devils_ begins in [Margate](/21c/21c-margate), where Seabrook connects [Eliot](/20c/20c-eliot-biography) with a series of mysterious, or recently erased, locales: the Victorian shelter overlooking the sands where he composed what was to become parts of ‘The Fire Sermon’, the Albermarle hotel (on the Eastern Esplanade in Cliftonville - gone), and, improbably, Dreamland, which had opened in 1920, and whose name looks forward to Seabrook’s second, obsessive chapter, ‘Daddlands’.  Taking in Ramsgate, Broadstairs (where Seabrook is less concerned with the obvious - because well attested - Dickensian links, and more keen to explore the scandalous backwaters linking George Curzon, John Buchan and Frank Richards), Deal and Dover - this is a local book for local people.  Or for DFL’s like me, who plump for life in cinque port semi-solitude, and who are therefore seldom exposed to the Seabrookian topoi of death, dirt, disease, murder.  And mystery.

_All the Devils Are Here_ is an essential addition to any library of the odd and uncommon.  Put Seabrook on a shelf with Kafka, Lovecraft, Beckett, Hoffmann, [Eco](/21c/21c-waterstones-canterbury) and Borges, and he fits right in: liminal, disruptive, hard to pin down.    
<br>
Final words?  Perhaps best to end with those from the _Observer_ review, ominously appended to the back page of the Granta edition: to know _Devils_, we are told, _‘is somehow not to know anything at all.’_   
It’s a right old mystery.
