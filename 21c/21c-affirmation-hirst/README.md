Affirmation

Make me a dress from the sounds of the leaves    
and the birdsong in Betteshanger churchyard;   
its colours will shimmer and change with the seasons.   
For shoes, choose grey bark, smooth as a sealskin,    
from the tallest beech in Aylesham Wood    
where the Adisham Road meets Pond Lane.   
The drumming of yaffle will nail on tough soles,   
chips from the oak felled at Finglesham.   
I’ll fashion my gloves and my hat from moss    
softly felted beneath a sweet chestnut at Blean.   
The scarf on my throat will be chiffon,   
woven by spiders and speckled with seeds     
from the blaze of an autumn hedgerow.    
And my winter coat will be green Kentish turf,   
warm as moleskin, smelling of topsoil and chalk.

I don’t know if this works
