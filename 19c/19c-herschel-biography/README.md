Two stars last night and sat up till two waiting for them. Ditto the night before. Sick of star-gazing—mean to break the telescopes and melt the mirrors'[^ref1] (Clerke, 154).  a letter of 23 July 1830 to his wife, Margaret:
<br><br>
Mathematician, astronomer and chemist, Sir John Frederick William Herschel moved to Collingwood House in Hawkhurst, Kent in 1840. The son of William Herschel, John named four of the moons of Uranus, the planet his father had discovered in 1781. 

Collingwood gave Herschel the skies he needed for his observations. He wrote:
<br><br>
'I must now observe, that on Friday, the 17th, and every evening since that time when I observed the comet, the zodaical light has also been displayed in the most striking and perfectly characteristic manner and, indeed with a brilliancy, which I should certainly be disposed to regard as a proof of the opinion generally entertained of its varying from season to season in its intensity, were it not for the habitual and exceeding purity of the atmosphere in this favoured corner of our island, which is altogether free from smoke, and most commonly so from haze, and (in the absence of actual cloud) quite upon a par (so far as three year’s residence will enable me to judge) with that of any region I have visited.'[^ref2] 
<br><br>
This was the Great Comet of 1843. Two nights later he observed that: 'The tail of the comet, for such it must assuredly be, is again visible, through much obscured by haze and holding very nearly the same position.'[^ref3]
