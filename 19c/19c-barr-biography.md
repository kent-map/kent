In December 1889 the local journal _Folkestone Visitors’ List and Society Journal_ (based in Tontine Street) reported excitedly that the humourist Robert Barr of the _Detroit Free Press_ had just arrived in London and was planning an extended stay in [Folkestone](19c-folkestone).[^ref1]  When Barr duly arrived in the summer of 1890 his companion was none other than the newly married and newly famous [Jerome K. Jerome](19c-jerome-biography), who had just published _Three Men in a Boat_. As a friend of editor and journalist ‘Hal Berte’ (whose real name of John Brown somehow sounds almost more fictional than the pseudonym), Barr was quickly contributing articles to the _Folkestone Visitor's List and Society Journal_. Gently mocking the aristocratic pretensions of a town where visitors not only expected to promenade on the Leas, but to do so in the right company, Barr breezily commented, ‘It is doubtless within the memory of the nobility and gentry of Folkestone, that I spent the summer there last year. I can prove this fact, because my name appeared in the _Visitors’ List_ at the time, and if you don’t believe me you can look up the back numbers of that journal.’[^ref2]  

Jerome would go on to co-edit Barr’s new publication _The Idler_ from 1892. While he later implied that they had had no previous relationship, he may have been remembering this very holiday in his account of [Folkestone](19c-folkestone) in _Three Men on the Bummel_ (1900). While Barr fell out with Jerome and ultimately withdrew from his editorial role at _The Idler_, he would contribute occasional articles to the Folkestone _List_ until 1894.
