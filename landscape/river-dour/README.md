**Wolverton**   
With one of its tributaries rising in the small hamlet of Wolverton, the River Dour is a small chalk stream that flows to the Port of Dover. Approximately four miles long, the Dour passes unobtusively through the urban landscape, its pre-industrial and industrial glories almost silenced as it gurgles under culverts and along footpaths.
<br><br>
A Bronze Age settlement at Wolverton and the remains of a Bronze Age boat near the Harbour indicate that the river may have been used by traders.

**Snar Gate**

Snar Gate, also known as Pier Gate was built about 1370. It was a sluice gate between the river and harbour. In 1588, it was taken down when the new harbour was built[^ref Statham 63) 

For Madox's Ford's described the Dour as a poor little river.
<br><br>
In among the houses one sees at times the poor little river Dour, a pathetic thread of silver that seems to have no real purpose in days like these. One thinks that its whole short course ought to be covered up and itself made to run through culverts. The principal part of its stream is supplied by a nailbourne, and when this chooses to run the Dour boasts a certain head of water. As a rule, it dribbles dispiritedly from Ewell to the sea, a distance of a few miles.
