Approximately four miles long, the River Dour is a small chalk stream which passes unobtusively through the urban landscape, its pre-industrial and industrial glories almost silenced as it gurgles under culverts and along footpaths to the Port of Dover.
<br><br>
In 1900, the novelist, poet and critic, Ford Madox Ford in _The Cinque Ports : A Historical and Descriptive Record_ dismissed the River Dour as unworthy of note:
<br><br>
In among the houses one sees at times the poor little river Dour, a pathetic thread of silver that seems to have no real purpose in days like these. One thinks that its whole short course ought to be covered up and itself made to run through culverts. The principal part of its stream is supplied by a nailbourne, and when this chooses to run the Dour boasts a certain head of water. As a rule, it dribbles dispiritedly from Ewell to the sea, a distance of a few miles.[^ref1] 
<br><br>
Ford failed to appreciate the natural beauty of the Dour, which forms an important habitat for brown trout, eels and stone loach as well as herons, kingfishers, ducks, coots and moorhen.[^ref2] In this article, we will take you from its source at Watersend to the sea.

**Watersend**  
The river Dour rises at Watersend, on the outskirts of the vllage of Temple Ewell (Ewell being the Old English for a river source or spring). Two watermills in the village supplied flour for the troops stationed at Dover during the Napoleonic Wars.

**Wolverton**   
A tributary of the Dour, the Drellingore, rises in the small hamlet of Wolverton, feeding into the River Dour near Bushy Ruff. In the 1930s it was said to flow every five to seven years.

A Bronze Age settlement at Wolverton and the remains of a Bronze Age boat near the Harbour indicate that the river may have been used by traders.

By 1900, the _Dover Express_ reported that "the River Dour has long ceased to be ornamental or very useful. In the olden towns no doubt its waters were clear enough to invite the coy trout to haunt it, but now fish would as soon make their home in a sewer."[^ref] "Nota Bene." Dover Express, 1 June 1900, p. 3. British Library Newspapers, link.gale.com/apps/doc/JF3239539234/GDCS?u=ccc_uni&sid=bookmark-GDCS&xid=901555fb. Accessed 20 Feb. 2025. They quipped "They say the Dour rhymes with sewer, but as some pronounce it, it rhymes with sour, both being supposed to be more or less correct."[^ref] "In the Street." Dover Express, 1 June 1900, p. 5. British Library Newspapers, link.gale.com/apps/doc/JF3239539267/GDCS?u=ccc_uni&sid=bookmark-GDCS&xid=2ac5b50f. Accessed 20 Feb. 2025. However, it complained "But because the Dour is of very little use is that any reason why the townsfolk should abuse it by allowing their sinks to empty into it, by casting therein the offal from slaughterhouses, the mud from surface drains, the useless tins from the provision merchants, and the refuse from the flour and paper mills." It called for the Corporation to force the mill owners to give up their rights to the dams and stop the pollution.[^ref] "Nota Bene." Dover Express, 1 June 1900, p. 3. British Library Newspapers, link.gale.com/apps/doc/JF3239539234/GDCS?u=ccc_uni&sid=bookmark-GDCS&xid=901555fb. Accessed 20 Feb. 2025.

In 1901, Dover Town Council bought the rights to the river for £300 and tore down the sluice gates at Stembrook Mill. In retaliation, the mill owner, Mr Brace, erected a dam of iron and piles forcing the Town Surveyors to send a squad of men to dismantle it. Brace rebuilt it and it was reported in the national press as "The Battle of the Dams".[^ref ] "The River Dour." Dover Express, 4 Oct. 1901, p. 5.

**Pencester Gardens**   
Emerging from a culvert under Pencester Road, the River Dour flows along the edge of Pencester Gardens. Originally the site of a timber store, the site was purchased by the Corporation for £5,000. "New Dover Recreation Ground." Kentish Express - Saturday 14 June 1924. The Gardens were opened on 6th June 1924 by Major Astor, M.P. The opening ceremony which included music from the Duke of Yorks Royal Military School band and a display from the gymastic squad was attended by more than 635 people. The public paid 3d for chairs at the event and £7 18s 9d was raised which went towards the Dover War Memorial Fund. In the evening, a large crowd gathered to hear the band play again, and the Connaught Male Voice Quartette sung a selection of pieces. "Pencester Gardens Opening." Dover Express - Friday 06 June 1924. "Pencester Gardens Opened." Dover Express - Friday 13 June 1924.
The _Dover Express_ commented that "now there is a path beside the Dour in Pencester Gardens, further efforts will be made to keep the water in the stream clearer. It may be impossible to do all that is desirable in this direction, but there is a great deal too much filth in the Dour." "Nota Bene." Dover Express - Friday 13 June 1924

**Snar Gate**

Snar Gate, also known as Pier Gate was built about 1370. It was a sluice gate between the river and harbour. In 1588, it was taken down when the new harbour was built[^ref Statham 63) 

**Wellington Dock**   
In 1846, the Duke of Wellington opened "Wellington Bridge" 
In 1888 Wellington Dock was improved to allow vessels of 800 tons.
In 1914 it was reported that "an immense quantity of filth" was brought down by the river into the dock and that the Sanitary Officers should be stricter in prosecuting the townsfolk who were treating the river like an "open drain"[^ref ]"The River Dour." _Dover Express_, 13 Mar. 1914, p. 2. British Library Newspapers, link.gale.com/apps/doc/JA3231215324/GDCS?u=ccc_uni&sid=bookmark-GDCS&xid=6f10375b. Accessed 20 Feb. 2025. Mud and weeds from the river also drifted down to the dock. By 1922, matters were no better as the river was "filled with household rubbish in the form of tin cans" and there were fears that the poor water quality would be hazardous to health.[^ref] The River Dour." Dover Express, 20 Oct. 1922, p. 7. British Library Newspapers, link.gale.com/apps/doc/JA3231247671/GDCS?u=ccc_uni&sid=bookmark-GDCS&xid=e7a41907. Accessed 20 Feb. 2025.
