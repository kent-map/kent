“It stands majestic, this great tower, looking out across the most sacred piece of our English earth. It looks across the fields where the Romans came with the sword; it looks across the fields where they came again in peace. It looks down on the ways by which came our first Englishmen. It stands in dazzling splendour, enthroned through the centuries, the shrine and cradle of our race” (Arthur Mee, Canterbury).

From the orchards and fields on the gently rising slopes of Stuppington Hill to the south of the city, are some of the finest views of Canterbury Cathedral. A sixteenth century map, The Civitates Orbis Terrarum, published in 1572, provides a bird’s eye view of Canterbury from this aspect. In the foreground, a small group of well-dressed Elizabethans, in fashionable cloaks, long dresses and ruffs, on a grassy hill, appear to be arriving at the city. One of these is possibly Dutch artist, Joris Hoefnagel, or another artist commissioned to map Canterbury, thus revealing the draughtsman’s perspective of the city, that of an outsider, sketched from the east of the River Stour and Wincheap.

Christian Jacob reminds us that one of the first questions we should ask of a map is “where am I?” but another question might be how did I arrive here? The artist and his companions could have reached the hill from ancient trackways that criss-crossed the area off Wincheap, passing the site where the Kentish martyrs had been executed during the reign of Mary Tudor, or from a path near St Lawrence’s Hospital which had been dissolved during the Reformation. The map offers only one mode of comprehending the space: the detached, bird’s eye view, suppressing the multiplicity of ways humans encounter environments.

The legend on the Civitates Orbis Terrarum reads ‘Cantuaria urbs fertilis simae anoliae celebris archiepisco pati sede commendata’ which translates as Canterbury, a fertile city, famous for its cathedral, entrusted as the seat of the archbishop. Fertile in this context may allude to the farmland owned by the Cathedral priory estates to the east of the city, rather than the clay-with-flint soil to the south of the city which was largely unsuited to arable agriculture (Lake, Edwards and Bannister p.113). Trees dotted along the Stour valley and an orchard in the grounds of St Augustine’s Abbey, reveal the significance of arboreal culture at this time. The William Smith Sloane map published over a decade later in 1588, viewed from the same perspective, only includes one tree at Lady Wootton’s Green and the water meadows near the Stour appear treeless. However, it is known that Leonard Cotton, gentleman of St. Margaret's, alderman and mayor of the city in 1580, left an orchard and its appurtenances in Winchepe in his will of 1605 (Hasted pp184-199). Maps, which are the subjective representations of the artist, become our reality, unless we challenge them.

J. B. Harley and Denis Wood argue that maps are not neutral mirrors of reality but symbolic systems that privilege certain forms of knowledge while excluding others. The heraldic shields on the Civitates Orbis Terrarum, reveal the power structures at play in the city - monarchy, Archepiscopat, ecclesia cathed. and ‘civitalis’. The spectacle created by the map is one of civic pride, power and privilege and celebrates a sixteenth century sense of progress, order and urbanity. Its publisher, Georg Braun, not only draws our attention to these, but is also creating audience.
