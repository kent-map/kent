Cooper’s Pit

Canterbury is at the intersection of two geological areas, the sticky London Clay beds to the north of the city and in the south the chalk of the North Downs. Cooper’s Pit is an [abandoned chalk quarry]( /landscape/chalk-pits-stig/) which has been designated a regionally important geological site (RIGS).[^ref1] Formerly known as Dane John Lime Works, it is located at the top of Lime Kiln Road in Wincheap.

The geology of the site is described in detail in the memoirs of the Geological Survey published by Smart, Bisson and Worssam. The pit is described as “the finest inland section in _M. [micraster] coranguinum_ chalk in the district’.[^ref2]  (p.155) The authors outline the soil and rock types which include soft white [chalk]( /landscape/kentish-chalk/), flint nodules and ‘abundant _Conulus_’.[^ref3] (156). Conulus were sea urchins that lived in the Cretaceous era, revealing that the land would have been submerged at this period. It was not until the end of the Chalk times (65 million years ago) that sea level fell.

A layer of tabular flint known as Whitaker’s Three-inch Band is a feature of the site’s geology, and these flints can also be found north of Merton Farm and on Hollow Lane about 450 yards NW of Stuppington Farm.[^ref4] (155). There is some “local silicification of the chalk at the contact with benched drift deposits exposed in this cutting”.[^ref5] (155) Silicification occurs when rocks or organic matter come into contact with silica-rich surface water. Silicates (or flints) are tough rocks that were used by Stone Age people to make axe heads and light fires. These rocks are buried under sediments where groundwater can flow through them. Over the years, the road has cut down through the chalk to a depth of more than 10 feet in places.[^ref6] Flint near the base of Cooper’s pit is ‘associated with brown loams and clays infilling fissures and cavities and deposited from percolating waters’ (p156). The Bullhead Bed is overlain by glauconitic sand, loamy sands, patches of clay and sandy clay.[^ref7](p.186)

The site was quarried for lime during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  Lime was used as a mortar, wash or plaster in stone structures such as churches and bridges, but also for agricultural purposes and street paving. In 1862, George Ashbee advertised in the Kentish Gazette that “lime may be had in any quantity at the Dane John Lime Kiln”[^ref8] (“Lime, Lime, Lime.” Kentish Gazette - Tuesday 14 October 1862). Just over a decade later, it was being worked by Charles Chapman who offered “the best burnt lime” to builders, farmers, etc.[^ref9] (“To builders, farmers, etc” Kentish Gazette, 12 November, 1878). The ordnance survey map of 1870 shows the chalk pit in the fields reached by a track and far from the present-day housing.  By 1889 the Elham Valley railway ran through the site with three lime kilns marked on the map and a tunnel allowing access to a fourth. Haselfoot records that “an extensive system of 2ft (61cm)- gauge mineral lines were used to transport chalk from the quarry faces to the kilns”[^ref10] (Haselfoot AJ 1978 The Ind Arch of South-East England London Batsford (29). This 1875 map shows the path to the Lime Kiln from the end of Gordon Road.
