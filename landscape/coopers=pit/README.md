Cooper’s Pit

Canterbury is at the intersection of two geological areas, the sticky London Clay beds to the north of the city and in the south the chalk of the North Downs. Cooper’s Pit is an [abandoned chalk quarry]( /landscape/chalk-pits-stig/) which has been designated a regionally important geological site (RIGS).[^ref1] Formerly known as Dane John Lime Works, it is located at the top of Lime Kiln Road in Wincheap.

The geology of the site is described in detail in the memoirs of the Geological Survey published by Smart, Bisson and Worssam. The pit is described as “the finest inland section in M. [micraster] coranguinum chalk in the district’  (p.155) The authors outline the soil and rock types which include soft white [chalk]( /landscape/kentish-chalk/), flint nodules and ‘abundant Conulus’ (156). Conulus were sea urchins that lived in the Cretaceous era, revealing that the land would have been submerged at this period. It was not until the end of the Chalk times (65 million years ago) that sea level fell.

A layer of tabular flint known as Whitaker’s Three-inch Band is a feature of the site’s geology, and these flints can also be found north of Merton Farm and on Hollow Lane about 450 yards NW of Stuppington Farm. (155). There is some “local silicification of the chalk at the contact with benched drift deposits exposed in this cutting” (155) Silicification occurs when rocks or organic matter come into contact with silica-rich surface water. Silicates (or flints) are tough rocks that were used by Stone Age people to make axe heads and light fires. These rocks are buried under sediments where groundwater can flow through them. Flint near the base of Cooper’s pit is ‘associated with brown loams and clays infilling fissures and cavities and deposited from percolating waters’ (p156). The Bullhead Bed is overlain by glauconitic sand, loamy sands, patches of clay and sandy clay.(p.186)
