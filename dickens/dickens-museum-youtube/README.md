The museum invites us to imagine ==Dickens=={7,8} gazing out of a window towards the sea or even to picture ourselves sitting at a desk writing about the neglected orphan who becomes a famous writer. 

==Pictures of Dickens and his characters fill the walls.=={13,14}

The room was as neat as Janet or my aunt. As I laid down my pen, a moment since, to think of it, the air from the sea came blowing in again, mixed with the perfume of the flowers; and I saw the old-fashioned furniture brightly rubbed and polished, my aunt’s inviolable chair and table by the round green fan in the bow-window, the drugget-covered carpet, the cat, the kettle-holder, the two canaries, the old china, the punchbowl full of dried rose-leaves, the tall press guarding all sorts of bottles and pots, and, wonderfully out of keeping with the rest, my dusty self upon the sofa, taking note of everything.

Dickens wrote the last words of David Copperfield while staying at Fort House a stone’s a few hundred yards along the cliff. He wrote to his best friend John Forster, ‘if I were to say half of what Copperfield makes me feel tonight, how strangely, even to you, I should be turned inside out! I seem to be sending some part of myself into the Shadowy World.’
