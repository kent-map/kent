'The sea is calm to-night. The tide is full, the moon lies fair Upon the straits ; — on the French coast the light Gleams and is gone ; the cliffs of England stand, Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay. Come to the window, sweet is the night-air ! Only, from the long line of spray Where the sea meets the moon-blanch'd land, Listen ! you hear the grating roar of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling' - _Dover Beach_ (1867) by Matthew Arnold
<br><br>
Dover has been the source of inspiration for writers over the centuries - with its white cliffs, beach and harbour, its magnificent castle, ferry boats and throng of visitors.

Sailors and their lovers are the subject of 18th century ballads about the town. _The Seaman of Dover_ (c.1755), for example, is a tale of Henry, a poor sailor, and Ruth, a squire's daughter from Sandwich. When Ruth's parents forbid her to marry Henry, he sails to Spain, where he marries a rich Spanish lady. In the meantime, Ruth runs away from home, dressed as a sailor, and searches for Henry whom she eventually espies walking along with his rich wife. 
<br><br>
When Henry's wife suddenly dies, Ruth reveals herself to Henry and they decide to return to England. Now impressed by Henry's wealth, Ruth's parents regret their decision to turn him away. He and Ruth, who has hidden her identity from her parent, invite them to their wedding and it is only when they spot a tell-tale mole on the bride that they realise that the woman dressed in a garment of gold is in fact Ruth. All ends well with seven days of feasting and bell-ringing.

In _Buxom Nan of Dover_ (1795) Dick of Dover, toasts his sweetheart Nan who often ran to meet him 'with straw-hat and pink streamers flowing'. He challenges his mess-mates to find a better woman 'of all the wenches whatsomever... so true, so kind, so clever, sweet, trim and neat, as Buxom Nan'.
<br><br>
In a later ballad, _Ned of Dover_ (1800), Nancy who is being wooed by a 'jovial British tar' on Dover beach tells him that although she loves jolly sailors they do have a habit of letting women down, leaving them "broken-hearted". When the boatswain bawls the signal to hove to, Nancy sheds a soft tear and hopes that Ned will be protected from danger.

During the Romantic period, authors such as Mary Shelley and Mary Wollstencraft, visited Dover en route to France. You can hear more about these in Dr Susan Civale's talk [A “dirty place”?](https://youtu.be/rL6fogIuRVQ?si=CHbNLTLy_eVMMfCD)

Travel and misadventures are also themes with the port and local ale houses providing a backdrop to several stories. Philip Thicknesse who published his _Useful Hints to those who Travel into France or Flanders, by way of Dover, Margate and Ostend_ in 1782 wrote 'It was my fate to be obliged to stay at Dover a compleat month, which gave me an opportunity of removing some prejudices, generally conceived againit that ancient city ; for I found at Mrs. Belcher's, the City of London, every thing that was good, and nothing like imposition ; and there are besides other good inns ; I found likewise a few people who were not only agreeable, but worthy of esteem and friendship.'
<br><br>
The City of London was run by Sophia Belchier as a Tavern, Inn, and Coffee-house on the Quay. It offered a large assortment of all kinds of liquors 'for the Accommodation of those who may favour her with their Commands' and offered 'a prospect of the Harbour, Castle and Sea'. [Kentish Gazette, 20 December, 1780; Kentish Gazette, 9 May, 1781.]

The play _Ways and Means; or a Trip to Dover: A Comedy in Three Acts_ printed in 1788, is set at The Ship, 'the oldest and best' inn in Dover,  where Mrs Peery is begging her husband to wake up and serve the rush of customers who are ringing the bar-bell: 'Sea and land cargoes and carriages, Four sea-sick gentlemen, from Calais; and four ladies, just step out of the Mail Coach'. The ladies complain that the mail coach is 'the worst conveyance in the world' as it 'squeezes four people together like two double letters'. [Charles Dickens](/dickens/dickens-dover/) stayed at the Ship Hotel for three days in the spring of 1856, while working on _Little Dorrit._

The two Englishmen, Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and Lord Anthony Dewhurst, who are carrying papers detailing the plans for the rescue of the Comte de Tournay and others, are dragged from the room by their masked assailants, as their host sleeps, and taken along the Dover Road 'into the gloom beyond' (70).

When the official calls out: ‘You, sir, beg pardon, did the other gentleman show his ticket?’ Karswell snarls angrily: ‘What the devil do you mean by the other gentleman?’ The railway official puzzles about what he has seen and ‘In five minutes more there was nothing but the lessening lights of the boat, the long line of the Dover lamps, the night breeze, and the moon.’

Set in Dover against the backdrop of the French Revolution, Thomas Armstrong's novel _Dover Harbour_ was published in 1942, and explores themes of local politics, smuggling, espionage and pressgangs. The book is full of local colour as this scene of a smuggling run illustrates: “The graveyard of St James’ Church, beneath the Castle Hill, was the scene of that night’s run. There, in the blackness of night, a single lantern cast its yellow light over crazy-leaning tombstones and on the soft carpet of grass and the pale gold of fallen leaves.” However, the smugglers evade detection: “Only the spirits of the dead were in the quiet churchyard of St James’s when Mr Toke and his men arrived. But there was a trail of tea from a punctured dollop, and a two-way track of planks as evidence of a large and carefully-planned run.”
