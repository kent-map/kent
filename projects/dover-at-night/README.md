'The sea is calm to-night.    
The tide is full, the moon lies fair   
Upon the straits ; — on the French coast the light    
Gleams and is gone ; the cliffs of England stand,    
Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.    
Come to the window, sweet is the night-air!    
Only, from the long line of spray    
Where the sea meets the moon-blanch'd land,    
Listen ! you hear the grating roar 
Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling  
At their return, up the high strand,   
Begin, and cease, and then again begin,   
With tremulous cadence slow, and bring   
The eternal note of sadness in.   
_Dover Beach_ (1867) by Matthew Arnold
<br><br>
Dover, with its white cliffs, beach and harbour, its magnificent castle, ferry boats and constant throng of visitors, has been the source of inspiration for many writers and poets over the centuries. At night, Dover becomes a place of mystery and adventure, with chance meetings, sad farewells, accidents, abductions and smuggling taking place on its moonlit shores.

In the 18th century, ballads about sailors and their lovers were popular. _The Seaman of Dover_ (c.1755), tells the tale of Henry and Ruth, who are parted by her parents and only marry when Henry returns a rich man. In _Buxom Nan of Dover_ (1795) Dick of Dover, toasts his sweetheart Nan who wears a straw-hat with pink streamers and challenges his mess-mates to find a better woman 'of all the wenches whatsomever... so true, so kind, so clever, sweet, trim and neat, as Buxom Nan'.

In a later ballad, _Ned of Dover_ (1800), Nancy who is being wooed by a 'jovial British tar' on Dover beach tells him that although she loves jolly sailors they do have a habit of letting women down, leaving them "broken-hearted". When the boatswain bawls the signal to hove to, Nancy sheds a soft tear and hopes that Ned will be protected from danger.

Authors such as Mary Shelley and Mary Wollstencraft, who visited Dover en route to France, wrote about the town as  [A “dirty place”?](https://youtu.be/rL6fogIuRVQ?si=CHbNLTLy_eVMMfCD) in their diaries and letters. Philip Thicknesse who published his _Useful Hints to those who Travel into France or Flanders, by way of Dover, Margate and Ostend_ in 1782 wrote 'It was my fate to be obliged to stay at Dover a compleat month, which gave me an opportunity of removing some prejudices, generally conceived againit that ancient city ; for I found at Mrs. Belcher's, the City of London, every thing that was good, and nothing like imposition ; and there are besides other good inns ; I found likewise a few people who were not only agreeable, but worthy of esteem and friendship.' The City of London was run by Sophia Belchier as a Tavern, Inn, and Coffee-house on the Quay and offered a large assortment of all kinds of liquors and 'a prospect of the Harbour, Castle and Sea'. [Kentish Gazette, 20 December, 1780; Kentish Gazette, 9 May, 1781.]

Travel and misadventures occur with the port and local ale houses providing a backdrop to several stories. The play _Ways and Means; or a Trip to Dover: A Comedy in Three Acts_ printed in 1788, is set at The Ship, 'the oldest and best' inn in Dover,  where Mrs Peery is begging her husband to wake up and serve the rush of customers who are ringing the bar-bell: 'Sea and land cargoes and carriages, Four sea-sick gentlemen, from Calais; and four ladies, just step out of the Mail Coach'. The ladies complain that the mail coach is 'the worst conveyance in the world' as it 'squeezes four people together like two double letters'. [Charles Dickens](/dickens/dickens-dover/) later stayed at the Ship Hotel for three days in the spring of 1856, while working on _Little Dorrit._

[In the 19th century](/19c/19c-dover/) Dover was visited by writers travelling to the continent including
[Charles Dickens](/dickens/dickens-dover/) who stayed in the town on a number of occasions. Having set part of _David Copperfield_ in Dover, Dickens stayed at the Ship Hotel for three days in the spring of 1856, while working on _Little Dorrit_. In [_A Tale of Two Cities_](/dickens/tale-two-cities/) Dickens writes of Dover: 'A little fishing was done in the port, and a quantity of strolling about by night'. (Dickens, 1875, p.20)

Children's author, [Jessie Challacombe](/19c/19c-challacombe-biography), was born in Dover in 1864 and with her parents Christopher and Martha Worsfold contributed to the life of Christ Church on the Folkestone Road. She was a member of the church’s young ladies’ working party and in 1890, gave a talk to the parents of the Sunday School scholars on the best way to bring up children: ‘Prayer, home-teaching, training, and the power of example were suggested as the four great means for directing the children aright.’5 This advice was later evidenced in her fiction, through her tales of Christian life.

[F.F. Montresor](/19c/19c-montresor-biography)'s novel _Into the Highways and Hedges_ published in 1895 is set in Dover where the beach is crowded with nursery-maids and children, Punch and Judy shows, minstrels, men selling indigestible gooseberries, beggars and women with false lace and ‘A fresh wind crisped the surface of the water, so that it was covered with curly white flecks, and it was hard to tell which was bluest, sea or sky'.

In [Baroness Orczy](/20c/20c-orczy-biography)'s _The Scarlet Pimpernel_ (1905) set in 1792, during the reign of Terror in France, two members of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel, a society dedicated to saving French aristocrats from the guillotine, are abducted by Citizen Chauvelin and a gang of men from The Fisherman's Rest in Dover. The Fishermen's Rest was an elegant and ordered coffee room, owned by Mr Jellyband - a typical 'John Bull' - and frequented by thirsty fishermen and passengers of the London and Dover coach, who stopped to enjoy the fine French wines and home-brew en route to the continent. The two Englishmen, Sir Andrew Ffoulkes and Lord Anthony Dewhurst, who are carrying papers detailing the plans for the rescue of the Comte de Tournay and others, are plotting in the bar after hours by the light of the fire, when they are dragged from the room by their masked assailants, as their host sleeps, and taken along the Dover Road 'into the gloom beyond' (70).

In 1905, [May Aldington](/20c/20c-aldington-biography), published her first book, _Love Letters that caused a Divorce_, a series of letters detailing the temptations of Kitty Yorke, and convinced the _Kentish Gazette_ office to fill its windows with copies.

Published in 1910 before both World Wars, _The Raid of Dover: A Romance of the Reign of Woman A.D. 1940_ by Douglas Morey Ford is a futuristic story set in Dover in 1940 in which England is invaded by Germany and the town suffers a bombardment of shells. Listen to this [excerpt](https://blogs.canterbury.ac.uk/library/wp-content/uploads/sites/638/2023/09/Dover.mp3) to hear his description of the bombardment.

[M.R. James](/20c/20c-jamesmr-biography/) story _Casting the Runes_ published in 1911, inspired the film _Night of the Demon_ (1957). In the story, Karswell, an alchemist and occultist, takes the train to Dover en route to the Continent. As he arrives in Dover, the ghostly apparition of John Harrington, a book reviewer who died in a freak accident after he was cursed by Karswell, is spotted by a railway official. When the official calls out: ‘You, sir, beg pardon, did the other gentleman show his ticket?’ Karswell snarls angrily: ‘What the devil do you mean by the other gentleman?’ The railway official puzzles about what he has seen and ‘In five minutes more there was nothing but the lessening lights of the boat, the long line of the Dover lamps, the night breeze, and the moon.’

Set in Dover against the backdrop of the French Revolution, Thomas Armstrong's novel _Dover Harbour_ was published in 1942, and explores themes of local politics, smuggling, espionage and pressgangs. The book is full of local colour as this scene of a smuggling run illustrates: “The graveyard of St James’ Church, beneath the Castle Hill, was the scene of that night’s run. There, in the blackness of night, a single lantern cast its yellow light over crazy-leaning tombstones and on the soft carpet of grass and the pale gold of fallen leaves.” However, the smugglers evade detection: “Only the spirits of the dead were in the quiet churchyard of St James’s when Mr Toke and his men arrived. But there was a trail of tea from a punctured dollop, and a two-way track of planks as evidence of a large and carefully-planned run.”
