'The sea is calm to-night. The tide is full, the moon lies fair Upon the straits ; — on the French coast the light Gleams and is gone ; the cliffs of England stand, Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay. Come to the window, sweet is the night-air ! Only, from the long line of spray Where the sea meets the moon-blanch'd land, Listen ! you hear the grating roar of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling' - _Dover Beach_ (1867) by Matthew Arnold
<br><br>
Dover has been the source of inspiration for writers over the centuries - with its white cliffs, beach and harbour, its magnificent castle, ferry boats and throng of visitors.

In the 18th century ballads of sailors and their lovers were popular. _The Seaman of Dover_ (c.1755), for example, is a tale of love between Henry who 'had conquered the hearts of many young damsels of beauty so bright' and Ruth, a squire's daughter from Sandwich whose parents lock her up in her chamber to prevent them marrying. Disappointed, Henry sails to Spain, where he marries a rich Spanish lady. In the meantime, Ruth runs away from home, dressed as a sailor, and searches for Henry whom she eventually finds in Calais with his rich wife. When his wife suddenly dies, Ruth reveals herself to Henry and they decide to return to England to marry. Now impressed by Henry's wealth, Ruth's parents regret their decision to turn him away. He and Ruth, who has hidden her identity from her parent, invite them to their wedding and it is only when they spot a tell-tale mole on the bride that they realise that the woman dressed in a garment of gold is in fact Ruth. All ends well with seven days of feasting and bell-ringing.

In _Buxom Nan of Dover_ (1795) Dick of Dover, toasts his sweetheart Nan who often ran to meet him 'with straw-hat and pink streamers flowing'. He challenges his mess-mates to find a better woman 'of all the wenches whatsomever... so true, so kind, so clever, sweet, trim and neat, as Buxom Nan'.

In a later ballad, _Ned of Dover_ (1800), Nancy who is being wooed by a 'jovial British tar' on Dover beach tells him that although she loves jolly sailors they do have a habit of letting women down, leaving them "broken-hearted". When the boatswain bawls the signal to hove to, Nancy sheds a soft tear and hopes that Ned will be protected from danger.

Travel caused much commentary, among locals and visitors. Philip Thicknesse who published his _Useful Hints to those who Travel into France or Flanders, by way of Dover, Margate and Ostend_ in 1782 wrote 'It was my fate to be obliged to stay at Dover a compleat month, which gave me an opportunity of removing some prejudices, generally conceived againit that ancient city ; for I found at Mrs. Belcher's, the City of London, every thing that was good, and nothing like imposition ; and there are besides other good inns ; I found likewise a few people who were not only agreeable, but worthy of esteem and friendship.'

The play _Ways and Means; or a Trip to Dover: A Comedy in Three Acts_ printed in 1788, is set in The Ship, 'the oldest and best' inn in Dover,  where Mrs Peery is begging her husband to wake up and serve the rush of customers who are ringing the bar-bell: 'Sea and land cargoes and carriages, Four sea-sick gentlemen, from Calais; and four ladies, just step out of the Mail Coach'. The ladies complain that the mail coach is 'the worst conveyance in the world' as it 'squeezes four people together like two double letters'.

Not only did he design the building, but also the decorative scheme and the furniture, including an impressive table surrounded by lion-headed chairs for the Mayor’s Parlour. Sadly, Burges did not live to see his vision as he died on the 20 April 1881.

Set in Dover against the backdrop of the French Revolution, Thomas Armstrong's novel _Dover Harbour_ was published in 1942, and explores themes of local politics, smuggling, espionage and pressgangs. The book is full of local colour as this scene of a smuggling run illustrates: “The graveyard of St James’ Church, beneath the Castle Hill, was the scene of that night’s run. There, in the blackness of night, a single lantern cast its yellow light over crazy-leaning tombstones and on the soft carpet of grass and the pale gold of fallen leaves.” However, the smugglers evade detection: “Only the spirits of the dead were in the quiet churchyard of St James’s when Mr Toke and his men arrived. But there was a trail of tea from a punctured dollop, and a two-way track of planks as evidence of a large and carefully-planned run.”
