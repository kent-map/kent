Coming soon!! The Ramsgate Clock House Museum contains documents relating to the history of the harbour including the letter conveying King George IV's "Gracious Pleasure that this port be called "The Royal Harbour of Ramsgate" and 'Harbour Minutes Register' 1909-1915 covering the early years of WW1. Roman artefacts with contemporary graffiti, recovered from the Richborough fort, as well as WW1 graffiti and important documents to tell the harbour's story, linking to Dunkirk small boats. The harbour, like the town, was subject to enemy attack and related problems and dangers associated with wartime activity.

Coming soon!! Deal Museum holds large collections of postcards, prints, photographs, records and newspapers that show the history of the town through the ages: naval town; smuggling town; base for the Royal Marines; mining town and seaside resort. The thread running through it is the beach - for example the by-elections in 1880 saw the beach as a site of electioneering, corruption and rioting, with canvassers jockeying to influence residents with 'a pint or a purse', resulting in the effective disenfranchisement of the constituency. 

## The Dickens Museum, Broadstairs

Coming soon!! Sandwich Guildhall Museum holds early 20th century postcards and cartes de visite. These collections show the vibrant life of the Cinque Port town, which has close links with neighbouring Deal, including correspondence addresses of early visitors to Sandwich that will stimulate research into visitor demographics from the start of the last century. This history has been eclipsed due to the greater accessibility of records relating to Thanet resorts.
