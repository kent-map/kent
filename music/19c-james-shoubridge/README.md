James Shoubridge was the last name on the list of men who were Lay Clerks at [Canterbury Cathedral](/music/19c-cathedral-singing) in 1825–6. Shoubridge was clearly a model Lay Clerk: in 1830, it was ‘Resolved that £10 a year each be given during pleasure to Shoubridge & Longhurst, Lay Clerks.’[^ref1]  There followed another gratuity in 1839: ‘James Shoubridge received a grant of £10 in addition to his stipend from July 6,’[^ref2]  again for no specified reason. In the event, he resigned the following year ‘upon obtaining an appointment at the Foundling [Hospital]’, as was recorded in the Precentor’s Book for the period.[^ref3]  He had a long and successful career from there: in 1857 he became a Vicar Choral at St Paul’s Cathedral and conductor of the Cecilian Society, London, in 1852.

The [Kentish Gazette](/18c/18c-kentish-gazette) reports make it clear that Shoubridge contributed significantly to the musical life of [Canterbury](/music/19c-music-canterbury): his singing is warmly received in reports from 1834,[^ref4]  but he seems to have been a leading light in the Sacred Harmonic Society, which first appears in the papers in that year:
<br><br>
SACRED HARMONIC SOCIETY   
Guildhall concert rooms, Canterbury   
A grand selection of SACRED MUSIC, from HANDEL’S Oratorio of the MESSIAH;    
HAYDN’S CREATION, &c., &c., will be given by upwards of SEVENTY VOCAL and    
INSTRUMENTAL PERFORMERS,   
On Monday evening, November 24, 1834.
<br><br>
The list of vocal soloists is practically identical to that of the Lay Clerks in that year: John Alexander Longhurst, Eastes, Young, James Shoubridge and his brother William, William Palmer and [Dobson](/music/19c-charles-dobson-biography). But Shoubridge conducts, and seems to be at the helm of the society for the rest of his time in [Canterbury](/19c/19c-canterbury).

This society seems to have outlasted Shoubridge by nearly twenty years, if the paper is accurate in its 1857 report that:
<br><br>
‘The Canterbury Sacred Harmonic Society, newly constituted as the ‘Glee and Madrigal Society,’ gave a performance on Tuesday evening at the Music Hall. To diversify the programme, Mr Macknay, the noted comic singer, was engaged; the band of the 79th Highlanders also assisted, and these varied entertainment attracted a large audience. […] Mr Lyon [Charles Lyon, another Lay Clerk] conducted on the occasion.’[^ref5]
<br><br>
The extent to which this society was able to move with the changing tastes of the times should have been a lesson to the [Catch Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=dbKAb18w72c&t=11s).
<br><br>
In another most serendipitous touch, James Shoubridge was replaced as Lay Clerk in 1841 by [William Henry Longhurst](/music/19c-william-longhurst-biography), who went on to play such an important role there and in the [Catch Club](/music/19c-catch-club). In fact, this was a technicality, since Longhurst had been ‘admitted to the Choir as Supernumerary & Assistant to Mr Jones, as Master of the Choristers’ in 1836,[^ref6]  continuing unbroken his service to the cathedral since joining as a chorister in 1828.
