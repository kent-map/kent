A glance through the pages of a local paper at any point in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries will furnish ample evidence of lively entertainment on offer, at least to those who could afford it and could gain access to the environments in which it took place.

## Charles Dobson

Charles Henry Dobson, a Canterbury cathedral singer with 14 years of service (1825–1839) is not mentioned in the Catch Club records, which is odd because his name crops up repeatedly in newspaper reports covering everything else musical in this period. 

## Thomas Goodban

According to the extensive journal of John Marsh, gentleman, barrister, and talented amateur musician, the few years he spent living at Nethersole, near Canterbury, were notable for the concerts in which he either played a leading role (as violinist, organist, composer, and/or organiser) or was an enthusiastic member of the audience.
