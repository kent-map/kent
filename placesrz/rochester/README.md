Rochester can only be known as the Historic Rochester, sitting along the River Medway and neighbouring Strood and Chatham within Medway it has always been an epicentre for Kentish History. From a first look at Rochester, you will gaze upon the high-standing Rochester Castle, a now crumbling but strong remain of what importance it once owned, overlooking the expanse of the town and river.

Perhaps what Rochester Castle is most famous for is the historical siege of the castle during the First Baron’s War where King John led a fierce siege on the inhabiting defenders utilising pigs to burn through toward the keep. But now it stands as a popular local tourist attraction to people visiting the area and provides a unique look on a once defensive and stalwart keep.

Beside the castle sits the grandiose Rochester Cathedral, a Norman architectural feat that has stood the test of time with its many spires and ornate architecture. It houses many medieval tombs providing the final residence for Bishops that once commanded the grounds.

A walk down the partially cobbled high street reveals a twist of time as we see old buildings lined along the streets with notes on the Guildhall museum to more modern shops that hold no historical relevance besides the ground they stand on, showing our Historic Rochester as shifting through the times and attempting to live in the past and the present. The high street is preserved in its own unique fashion with these aged structures but the constant hum of modernity is driving its way through it for better or for worse. What is to not mention of Rochester but the Sweeps festival a historic coming of spring festival that brings the streets to life with parades and music with cheer all around for most walks of life that eventually lead to the pubs dotted within Rochester.

So what else is in store for Rochester? Will it become a landmark comparable to the likes of Canterbury in the future, or will it remain a small but cosy historic town that holds interest in the eyes of intrigued historians? It sees new infrastructure like the revamped train station and other small areas but the tests of time are what is required to see whether it will thrive in the past or surge into a new future.
