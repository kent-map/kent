## Broadstairs in the 19th century

Despite being the favoured holiday destination of no less a figure than Charles Dickens, Broadstairs never aimed to compete with either the much-vaunted gentility of Ramsgate or the mass appeal of Margate.

## Canterbury in the 19th century

One of the more surprising features of Canterbury is that, despite the cathedral being the home of the Church of England, no Archbishop of Canterbury was enthroned there until John Bird Sumner in 1848. 

## Canterbury in the 20th century

A series of short essays covers a range of themes that help explain how Canterbury developed into the city that it is today.

## Deal by the Sea

The town of Deal first developed a mile or so inland. But in seventeenth century “Lower Deal”, a network of streets running north of Deal Castle, began to call the shots.

## Deal's War on the Shore

Primarily known for its long stretch of shingle beach, Deal may appear like any seaside town to most, but there is a vast history below the waves and onshore. The town has been involved in war and conflict throughout time.

## Dover in the 19th century

Like Ramsgate, Dover considered itself to be among the more genteel of the 19th century seaside resorts.
