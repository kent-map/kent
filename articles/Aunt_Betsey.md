### Aunt Betsey

Betsey Trotwood’s later appearance as a brusque but kindly eccentric can easily eclipse the reader’s first impression of her as the invader of Clara Copperfield’s home hours before she gives birth to a fatherless David. She will take the child in herself when he finally escapes from the brutal Murdstones, but like other characters in the novel, Betsey has secrets to hide.
