### Agnes Wickfield

Pursued by a lustful and ambitious Uriah Heep, Agnes Wickfield has found few admirers among modern readers. One of Dickensâ€™s good daughters and quietly efficient housekeepers, she is (in her defence) notably loyal when a drunken David accosts her in front of her respectable acquaintances at a London theatre. She has to wait for the hardly less insipid Dora to die before finally getting her man.
