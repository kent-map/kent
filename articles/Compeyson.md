### Compeyson

A plausible adventurer, the middle class Compeyson has plotted with Miss Havisham’s brother in the pre-history of the novel to humiliate her by becoming engaged to her and then jilting her on the wedding day. He has subsequently become involved with Magwitch, but received a much lighter sentence when they are both tried for the crime he himself engineered. Pip is twice a witness to Magwitch’s assaults on Compeyson, first on the marshes and many years later in the river near Gravesend.
