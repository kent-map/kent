### Pumblechook

The pompous corn chandler Pumblechook is every child’s worst nightmare. With a respectable business on the High Street in Rochester, he orchestrates Pip’s invitation to Satis House and takes him there. But:
his conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic. On my politely bidding him Good morning, he said, pompously, "Seven times nine, boy?" And how should I be able to answer, dodged in that way, in a strange place, on an empty stomach! I was hungry, but before I had swallowed a morsel, he began a running sum that lasted all through the breakfast. http://www.online-literature.com/dickens/greatexpectations/8/
Pumblechook later claims that he was Pip’s benefactor and friend, only to denounce him as soon as his fortune is lost.
