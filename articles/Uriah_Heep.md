### Uriah Heep

Writhing and repulsive, Uriah is the lawyer Mr Wickfield’s insinuating clerk and for a time becomes his partner. As he candidly admits to David, ‘I ate umble pie with an appetite’ to appease his social superiors even as he planned to get his revenge. He wriggles to the top of the provincial ladder by falsifying accounts while his employer is too inebriated to take in what is happening. The ultimate test of Agnes’s virtue is that she almost consents to marry him to save her father from ruin.
