### Mr Murdstone

Second husband of Clara Copperfield, Mr Murdstone is not a sadist because he takes no enjoyment in anything. But it would take a pedant to spot the difference. Having compared David to a horse or a dog, he stresses the point by whipping him. When David retaliates by biting him, Murdstone despatches him to the brutal regime of Salem House. On his mother’s death David is removed from formal education altogether and put to work ‘not fit for me’ until he finally finds a refuge with Betsey Trotwood.
