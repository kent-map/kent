### Miss Larkins

‘Perhaps the eldest Miss Larkins may be about thirty. My passion for her is beyond all bounds.’ Looking back on his 17 year old self an indulgent David remembers thinking that at least he would be 21 in a few years, apparently forgetting that the object of his devotion would by then be 34. He is deeply dejected for at least a week when she marries an elderly hop grower by the name of Chestle.
