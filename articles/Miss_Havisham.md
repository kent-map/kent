label: Miss Havisham

To Pip Miss Havisham appears always as old and grotesque, being ‘withered’ with ‘sunken eyes’. In his struggle to depict the impression she first makes on him he compares her to a ‘ghastly waxwork’ and a skeleton. It may come as an almost equal shock to the reader that – from the internal chronology later provided by Herbert Pocket – she is probably somewhere in her forties. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEVl1Ec92s8  But in one sense her age is immaterial, as she deliberately stops all the clocks at the very time of her betrayal by Compeyson on what would have been her wedding day.
