# Contributing to the Kent Maps project

## Create a personal copy of the kent Github repository for development

1. Fork a copy of the [kent-map/kent](https://github.com/kent-map/kent) Github repository into your own Github account.

2. After forking the repository, configure your forked repository to operate as a [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) website.  This is accomplished by selecting the `Settings` option from the menu at the top of the repository home page.  From the settings page select the `Pages` option from the left sidebar menu.  In the `settings/pages` page, select `main` from the `Branch` pull-down menu and then press the `Save` button.

3. After completing the steps above it may take a minute or two for the configured website to become active.  Once it is active you will have a fully functioning clone of the Kent Maps web site running from your forked copy.  The url will be `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/github.io/kent`

## Make additions/changes in your personal copy of the Kent Maps site

Make desired additions and/or modifications in your forked copy of the kent repository.  These changes can be viewed using the Github pages website configured for your repository.  For instance, if a new essay (named `my-new-essay`) was added was added to the repository root, it would be viewed at the URL `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/github.io/kent/my-new-essay`.

> *Note that changes made in the repository can take up to a minute or more to become active in the Github Pages website.*

## Contribute your changes back to the Kent Maps project

After changes have been made and tested using the Github Pages server, they may be contributed back to the main Kent Maps project.  This is accomplished by submitting a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to the `kent-map/kent` repository administrators. 

  1. A pull request is initiated using the `Contribute` pull-down menu found on the home page of your forked repository.  From the `Contribute` pull-down menu select `Open pull request`.  From the next page select `Create pull request`.  This will take you to a `Compare changes` page that will identify the changes to be included in the pull request, and subsequently applied to the `kent-map/kent` repository if approved by a Kent Maps project administrator.
  2. From the `Compare changes` page make any needed changes.  Once you're satisfied that the changes to be proposed are correct, select the `Create pull request` button located in the top-right portion of the page.
  3. In the `Open a pull request` page, update the title and description to reflect the changes that are being proposed in the request.  Once that has been accomplished, submit the pull request by pressing the `Create pull request` button.

  That's it.  Your proposed changes have been submitted to the Kent Maps project administrators for inclusion in the site.
