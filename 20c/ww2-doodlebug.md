The year 1944 was one of wide and devastating humanitarian loss for Kent, particularly due to the impact of a newly invented ‘revenge weapon’ (Vergeltungswaffen) used by the Germans towards the end of WW2: the V-1 flying bomb, also known as the doodlebug. Nicknamed thus because of its erratic movement and the buzzing noise which signalled its arrival overhead, the doodlebug was a flying bomb powered by a jet engine. The heavy bombing of Kent with 2,400 doodlebugs in the Summer of 1944 would lead to this period being known retrospectively as ‘Doodlebug Summer’.

Despite its somewhat light-hearted nickname, the doodlebug was a source of great terror for civilians, both across the period in which these bombs were heavily utilised, and the immediate instance in which they appeared in the sky. This immediate sense of terror was conjured by the eerie noise accompanying a doodlebug’s flight and the anticipation involved in listening for its buzzing noise to stop momentarily, which meant the bomb was about to fall. Peter, a resident in Kent during the war, describes his experience of this:

> "I remember them very clearly. They made a sound like a lorry engine going very fast. They kept flying until they ran out of fuel. Then they simply fell to the ground and exploded. Whenever we heard a doodlebug everyone looked up and followed it with their eyes until it had gone over past where we were standing. If the engine stopped before it got to us that was the time to worry! Sometimes a doodlebug dropped to earth immediately and sometimes it would continue to glide, gradually losing height. Very scary!" - Peter Kitcherside, 2005, WW2 People's War.[^ref1]

Peter goes on to say that by September 1944, Germans were sending out huge, rocket-engine fuelled V-2 bombs, which were much faster than V-1s – with doodlebugs flying at around 400mph, and V-2s able to travel at the speed of sound, meaning they could not be heard. Peter says this made them much more deadly in their impact, but to him, 'not as scary' as doodlebugs.[^ref2]

A map in ‘The Kent Messenger’ from the Summer of 1944 shows the extent of the bombing in the Kent Section of the South East of England, providing a visual explanation for the name ‘Bomb Alley’ that was given to Kent during the Blitz.[^ref3] Kent’s location on route to the more densely populated city of London, which was the Germans’ main target, meant that enemy bombers who ran out of fuel or were shot down before they reached London, as well as any bombs that fell short of their target, would fall on Kent instead.

However, with heavy bombing on the capital massively impacting public morale, the British government decided to leak false information to the Germans in an effort to redirect doodlebugs away from the centre of London towards Kent, and thus minimise civilian deaths.[^ref4] This calculation, as Professor Eric Grove explains, aimed to 'sacrifice lives in the countryside to avoid heavier casualties in London'.[^ref5] Double agents working for the Allies deceived the Germans into thinking the doodlebugs were landing too far north, and the deception was successful in changing the course of the bombs to hit Kent and the south of London instead. Kent resident Daphne Mitchel explains this in her own words:

> "Later on, the Government made a statement that most of the bombs were flying past London and that the Germans had miscalculated the range. The Germans heard this and shortened the distance; this caused a large number of bombs to fall short, which was good for London but not good news for Kent." - Daphne Mitchel, 2004, BBC WW2 People's War.[^ref6]

Though the decision to change the path of the bombs saved many lives in London, the ethics of the government’s decision to interfere with the destination of the bombs has been considered highly controversial. By the end of the war, doodlebugs had killed over 6,000 people in Britain, with the final doodlebug hitting Orpington on March 27th, 1945.[^ref7]
