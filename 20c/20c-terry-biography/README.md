Ellen Terry was the superstar English actress of the Victorian period. Born to a theatrical family, she first trod the boards aged eight in the part of Mamillius in _The Winter’s Tale_. She is best known for her long theatrical partnership with Sir Henry Irving, performing at the Lyceum Theatre, London, and throughout the UK and the US.   
<br>
She is also known for her series of highly-acclaimed lectures about Shakespeare’s women (and the book that resulted – _Four Lectures on Shakespeare_ – written by Ellen Terry and edited by her ‘literary henchman’ [Christopher St John](/20c/20c-st-john-biography).

In 1900, she bought her last home, Smallhythe[^ref1] Place, a Tudor farmhouse in the Kent marshes outside Tenterden, as a retreat from her busy London theatrical life. Terry’s biographer, Nina Auerbach, called it ‘a pocket of eerie stillness in the Kentish countryside’. [^ref2]
<br><br>
Ellen Terry wrote of her new home:
<br>
‘It’s pretty rough at the Farmhouse! ‘The simple life’ indeed! But at least there’s a jolly big Bath there.’ [^ref3]

She gifted the adjacent ‘Priest’s House’ to her daughter, Edith [‘Edy’ Craig](/20c/20c-craig-biography), who lived in it with her life partners – the writer [Christopher St John](/20c/20c-st-john-biography) (Christabel Marshall), and after 1916 with St John and the artist, Clare ‘Tony’ Atwood.

Ellen Terry wrote about life with Edy at Smallhythe Place (then called The Farm) in a letter to George Bernard Shaw (14 June 1904), 
<br><br>
‘Edy is here. Did I tell you she is my right hand, and still growing to be my left hand, and happy as a sandboy all the while? I fear to be too happy in her – I try to very quiet with it all. She has a cottage of her own here and we visit each other every day!’ [^ref4]

[Christopher St John](/20c/20c-st-john-biography) characterised her early life with Ellen Terry and [Edy Craig](/20c/20c-craig-biography) at Smallhythe as ‘a lovely pleasant carefree existence’. They created beautiful gardens, went on moonlight drives to Bodiam Castle, and took the occasional pleasure cruise across the English Channel to Bruges.

[St John](/20c/20c-st-john-biography) wrote that the many ‘monuments’ to Ellen Terry – her autobiography, letters, and lectures on Shakespeare ‘as well as her shrine at Smallhythe’ – were ‘something to inspire those who come after us with the same devotion to her memory.’[^ref5]
