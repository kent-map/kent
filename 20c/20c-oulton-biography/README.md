My father Harry Charles Neil Maxwell Oulton was born in Dublin on 11 February 1919, to Anglo-Irish parents. Both he and his brother Antony Derek Maxwell Oulton (b. 14 October 1927) attended Matfield Grange prep school near Tunbridge Wells. [MC: see attached images ‘Matfield Grange’ / HCO bowling]

The school was run by Charles Perkin (CAP), brother in law of the boys’ maternal uncle Joseph Maxwell. Joe’s wife Dodie ‘remembered dancing with the writer [Siegfried Sassoon](//20c/20c-sassoon-biography/) who lived in a neighbouring village, in the days when the matrons sitting round the floor considered that it was “fast” to reverse in the waltz.’[^ref1] Harry sent a postcard to his mother on his arrival in 1926, enthusing about his new environment. ‘School is lovly’ [sic] he wrote, ‘My desk is one of the double ones.’[^ref2]

In 1935 Derek too went to Matfield Grange.[^ref3] His parents brought him over from Egypt, where the family were now living, and he remembered a summer holiday in this year, ‘at a farm house near [Canterbury](/canterbury/20c-canterbury-overview) called Paramour Grange, which led to my very moral mother getting startled comments from her friends. It was there, in the little Kent village of Ash, that she bought me my first bicycle’.[^ref4] In the same year Uncle Joe took up a post as the Surgical Specialist at RN Hospital Chatham, and the Maxwell boys accordingly went to school with Derek.[^ref5] Derek’s holidays were spent largely with these cousins in Kent. 

In 1937 Harry was awarded an exhibition to King’s College, Cambridge, meaning that he was not too far away from his younger brother. Derek later recalled, ‘Without him we should never have tried to manufacture gunpowder to unblock a drain, ski-jump our bicycles into the air and buckle their front wheels, or climb the Tower of the Naval Hospital at [Chatham](/19c/19c-chatham-dockyard) and stop the clock, to the great scandal and inconvenience of the whole hospital.’[^ref6] 

But Harry cut short his university career, joining G Battery (Mercers Troop) RHA in December 1939. [MC: Image attached] He was evacuated from Dunkirk on 1 June 1940, in the destroyer [H.M.S. Winchelsea]( <iframe src="https://www.iwm.org.uk/embed/?id=1060020101&media_id=612451" height="430" width="480" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe>)]. The ship was bombed twice (once at about 15 yards), landing at Dover[^ref7] (where [Operation Dynamo](/20c/20c-secret-tunnels/) was planned). When his train stopped at Paddock Wood, ‘he got a friendly woman handing out tea and buns to ring up the CAPS and say he was safe.’[^ref8]  Family legend has it that unfortunately he forgot to contact his parents for another week.[^ref9] Matfield Grange was hit by a land mine [MC: see attached image] that October. Harry spent the last few years of the war in North Africa with the Desert Rats, where he was awarded an MC and bar.  After leaving school, Derek did his two years’ national service as a signalman in the Royal Navy.

Harry’s connection with Kent was briefly revived in 1949, when he bought a Tipsy monoplane and decided to fly it back to the Sudan following a period of leave. As he cheerfully remarked in his account of this trip, _The Flying Broomstick_, ‘Despite its open cockpit there was no need to wear a helmet, although in England you needed a scarf. …On the minus side it had no tail wheel, only a bamboo, metal-shod skid; and no wireless, lights, luminous instrument gauges, self-starter or brakes. Also, it would be impossible to get spare parts.’[^ref10] He had limited flying experience, although one newspaper wrongly assumed that he had been a pilot during the war.

This time Harry did remember to write to his father, ‘in Arabic, so that my mother should learn nothing of it until I had arrived safely in Khartoum. … In due course, my father wrote back, thanking me for not telling my mother but reminding me that I was his son also and asking why the plane had cost so little.’[^ref11] Take-off from Lympne was delayed on 30 September because ‘I had spent a lot of time at my uncle’s school and made matters worse by returning to drop a toy parachute over it, which was never found.’[^ref12]  He was also found to have incomplete paperwork. By the time this was resolved it was too late to begin the flight, and he accordingly spent the night at the Lympne Country Club, setting off the next morning.[^ref13] 

The _Sudan Star_ ran a front-page article on the trip after Harry’s successful arrival in what it described as ‘probably the lowest powered aircraft ever to make the trip.’[^ref14] [MC: see attached image of newspaper cutting] In 1962 the magazine _Popular Flying_ ran 2 instalments of _The Flying Broomstick_, but discontinued the series after coming ‘under a certain amount of fire from the Ministry of Aviation regarding one or two unfortunate incidents’.[^ref15]

Derek went on to take a double first in Law from King’s College, Cambridge. He was called to the bar in 1952 and joined the Lord Chancellor’s Office in 1960. He was described after his death in 2016 as ‘one of the greatest civil servants of his generation.’[^ref16] [MC: image of Derek attached] 

Neither of the brothers lived in Kent again, although my mother tells me that Harry talked about retiring here. On my visits to Chatham Dockyard, I always make a point of checking the clock.
