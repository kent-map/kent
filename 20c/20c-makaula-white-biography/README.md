Albert Makaula, the son of a Bhaca Chief, was born in the Eastern Cape in 1865.[^ref1] Although he started life in South Africa, he later settled in Kent where he became a farmer. 
<br><br>
As the age of nine months, Albert grew seriously ill. His sickness was seen as a bad omen among the Bhaca people who feared that a great calamity would befall the tribe. Chief Makaula and Albert's mother, Mamagayiyana (The Great Wife) tried everything to cure Albert.[^ref2] Growing desperate, Albert's mother walked 20 miles to the mission station at Tshungwana (Osborn) carrying Albert on her back, whilst Chief Makaula followed on horseback. Here they asked the English missionary, Reverend Charles White to help save their son, saying: "Here is a thing that I have brought you; if it lives it is yours, if it dies, bury it."[^ref3] Charles and Martha White, who had no children of their own, agreed to look after Albert and he recovered. The Whites adopted Albert, who was the Chief's second son, and he added White to his name, making him Albert Makaula-White. He lived with the Whites for 15 years.

Albert grew up as a Black child amongst White people. He integrated well and is described as speaking perfect English and enjoyed conversing, particularly with adults, although he didn't learn his native tongue until he was 16.[^ref3] Most of his youth was spent in South Africa; where he would have witnessed the tribal conflict that took place and the impact that this had on the local community. In 1871, Chief Makaula asked Reverend White to act as an intermediary between the AmaBhaca and the warring Griquas, but White struggled to broker peace and the mission station became crowded with displaced women and children fleeing the aggression.[^ref4] Whilst Albert was living in Africa, he taught at a missionary school which had over 200 pupils.[^ref]
<br><br>
In 1888, Makaula-White came to the UK and visited Henry Darney, father in law of the Colonial Resident Magistrate in Bacaland, at his home in Kinghorn, Scotland.[^ref5]

After the death of his adoptive parents, Albert, funded by the South African Methodist Conference trained to become a clergyman at the Richmond Theological College in Surrey. It was whilst he was here that he conducted services at Wesleyan Chapels in Thame[^ref5], Banbury[^ref6] and Winchcombe.[^ref6] 
<br><br>
After leaving the college, Albert married Eleanor Botting at Wesleyan Methodist Church in Strood, Kent in December 1891.[^ref4] Eleanor was a local dressmaker and the daughter of a carpenter. Interracial relationships in the late 19th century and in the early 20th century became more regular, but no means common. Eleanor's parents did attend the wedding. However, many people in interracial relationships and/or mixed-race people were met with disapproval and often faced similar or worse discrimination than Black people. This can be demonstrated by the fact that mixed ethnicity only became an option in the 2001 Census, 110 years after Albert and Eleanor's marriage.[^ref5] Before this, mixed-race people were called Negros or Coloured (these were considered the polite terms). 
<br><br>
Not long after their marriage, the couple moved to South Africa. Albert found work as an interpreter to the Magistrate of Idutywa and in 1901, Albert acted as interpreter for his father at a meeting of assembled chiefs, during a visit from the Duke and Duchess of York. He was later appointed as Chief Constable of Libode but was sacked from this post in 1902.[^ref ] The Makaula-Whites had three children, all born in South Africa: Irene, in 1893, Charles in 1897 and Claude in 1898.

In 1904, the Makaula-Whites moved to Kent. It is here that Albert began farming[^ref6] at Stubble Hill near Harrietsham [^ref7] and where he remained until at least 1911. It would have been unusual to have a Black man in a rural community. However, Albert's familiarity with British way of life aided his family's integration into Kent. Jo Beany recalled her Grandfather's account of working for the Makaula-Whites: "Granddad couldn't speak highly enough of the Makaula-Whites. Wonderful people, very considerate of their workforce. Always a good supply of tea and soft drinks, much appreciated on those hot summer days."[^ref8]
<br><br>
At the end of 1906, Albert's father died leaving over 100 sons and daughters. His older brother, Mncisane, became the new Chief.

Although now farming, Albert retained his links with the Methodist Community, giving talks about his life and the missionary work in South Africa. In 1912, he gave a talk at the Burbank Church of the West Hartlepool Circuit of the United Methodist Churches on the introduction of the gospel to the Amabaca, and sang a song in the Kaffir language.[^ref9] 
<br><br>
By 1913, the Makaula-Whites were living in Thanet as Albert advertised in the _Kent Messenger_ "wanted 40 bushels of soot, delivered at Minster Station - Rose Lawn, Minster, Ramsgate." The soil around Minster was loam, so soot was used by farmers to darken the soil so that it absorbed more heat from the sun. As a result the higher temperature of the soil would help bring the season forward a little. 
<br><br>
It was whilst he was living at Minster that Albert became a member of the Minster Primitive Methodist Circuit, presiding over the circuit meeting in June 1914.[^ref9]. The Primitive Methodists differed from the Wesleyan Methodists in that they allowed lay participation in the church. Later that year, Albert invited fellow African Dr Rubusana, who had been visiting England to interview the Colonial Secretary over the land question, to speak at a Brotherhood meeting in Minster, where they sung a duet in their native language.[^ref10] 
<br><br>
During 1916-17, Makaula White contributed entertainment to concerts raising money for wounded soldiers and allowed the wounded soldiers to use his tennis court. [Kentish Express - Saturday 16 June 1923] 

The post-war period was a difficult time for farmers. Canterbury cathedral's tithe agent, noting a problem with non-payment in the Minster area, wrote to farmers threatening to serve a county court notice on them.[Bulaitis 82] An agricultural depression had seen wheat prices plummet (Bulaitis 117) and among non-conformist communities such as the Methodists, the payment of tithes to the Church of England seemed like an "unjust tax on agrictulture". (Rev Kedward cited by xvi Bulaitis). It is not known how much these events affected Albert and his family but they reveal how difficult it was to be a farmer at this period.
<br><br>
It was around this time that Albert joined the freemasons and is reputed to be Britain's first Black freemason [^ref9] as a member of Lewises Lodge, Ramsgate. In 1920, he gave a talk to the Ramsgate Brotherhood on the "Habits and Customs of his Tribe" at the Primitive Methodist Church on Queen Street, using tribal weapons and beads to illustrate his talk [^ref10] By 1921, he was living with his family at 61, Ellington Road, Ramsgate. His daughter Irene was running dance classes in the town [East Kent Times and Mail - Wednesday 28 September 1921.] However, a robbery at their house as well as accusations against his son Charles for theft may have encouraged the family to move away.

By June 1924, the Makaula Whites were living at Beech Court, Challock. It was whilst living here that Makaula White attended the Badlesmere Whist Drive and sang humourous songs, revealing his sociability and keeness to be part of community life. [Badlesmere Kentish Express - Saturday 25 October 1924] However, the sale by auction of live and dead farming stock and the effects of Beech Court Farm, Challock in October 1924 reveal that the family did not stay here long.[^ref11] Albert sold off 2 dairy cows, 2 cart horses, a young Welsh mare and foal, 85 pigs 95 sheep, 200 poultry and nearly new agricultural implements. It must have been disappointing for him and his family. [Beech COurt Kent Messenger & Gravesend Telegraph - Saturday 18 October 1924]

During the period 1925-1928, Makaula-White and Sons were running Poverest Farm in St Mary Cray.[^ref9] The Farm consisted of 2 cottages and 153 acres. [U2791/T3 Kent History and Library Centre] Life at St Mary Cray was not without its challenges. In December 1927, Albert was taken to court after a neighbour accused Albert of letting his pigs eat his garden plants. The reporting of the court case reveals racial tensions as the complainant suggested that the act was deliberate and Albert replied that he believed that he was a victim of "prejudice against colour".[^ref10]
<br><br>
The winter of 1927 into 1928 was extremely cold and snowy.[^ref10] Many roads and paths had to be dug out so that people could access the outer world after being snowed in. The extreme weather would have a costly effect on Albert. In January 1928, the RSPCA took Albert to court for neglecting his pigs.[^ref11] Albert declared to the court that he sold all of the pigs in question to Commander Egleton around Christmas. The pair came to a gentleman's agreement that Albert would house the pigs until Egleton would collect them in January. In the meantime, Egleton's farm manager was to feed the pigs. However, he claimed there was a miscommunication, and he believed Albert was also meant to feed the pigs part of the time.[^ref12] Albert's defence lawyer argued that Makaula-White had been "subjected to a great deal of persecution by neighbours" on account of his colour and that many farm animals had frozen to death that winter and these cases had not been brought to prosecution. [Bromley & West Kent Mercury - Friday 20 January 1928] Both parties were fined. Albert was fined £10, approximately £460 (as of 2017).[^ref13] This gained unwanted public attention. 
<br><br>
The Makaula-Whites moved to Court Lodge in Doddington in 1929. At Court Lodge, they dealt only with wheat, barley, oats, and beans. Albert remained here until at least 1933 and gave talks at the Bethel Congregational Church, Queenborough on his life as a Christian worker.[^ref1]. His presence in these communities attracted interest and children asked for his autograph as the son of a "Zulu" Chief.

As Albert aged, his financial issues grew, and his mental health declined. He remained working in the agricultural industry but in 1933 wrote to a former acquaintance in South Africa asking for financial support.[^ref13] By the 1930s, the British Fascist movement were whipping up support among agricultural communities and political ideologies created tensions among farming communities. A Blackshirt Agricultural Tour in 1934 visited villages around Ashford, Canterbury, New Romney, Chatham, Sandwich, Chiselhurst, Westerham, Orpington and Sevenoaks. Life in rural communities would have felt uncomfortable for the family at this period.  
<br><br>
Albert died on 13th September 1937 at the The Haven, Goudhurst where he had been living for about three months. He was buried at Lenham where a wreath from the British Coloured People's League was laid at his funeral.[^ref14] After her husband's death, Eleanor lived with Claude in Maidstone until she died in 1944, and was also buried at Lenham. 

Albert's children maintained their roots with Kent. Charles lived at Great Napchester Farm, Whitfield and later Eythorne. Claude moved around the country to pursue a cricket career, in the late 1930s he moved to Maidstone. Princess Irene, became a theatrical performer who lived mainly in France. 
<br><br>
Albert Makaula-White's life was a testament to resilience and determination. Despite his uncertain beginning, he rose above his challenges, whether in the scorching sun of South Africa or the snowy streets of Kent.
