Coach Tour of Joseph Conrad’s Homes in Kent

This article draws on a pamphlet entitled Coach Tour of Joseph Conrad’s Homes in Kent by Borys Conrad. Written by Joseph Conrad’s eldest son, the pamphlet was issued in 1974, just four years before its author’s death. It is a charming production, comprised of only eight leaves, in light blue paper wraps with the Nałęcz coat of arms to the front panel, and contains six photographic plates – five being of Conrad’s homes, and another of the man himself. It is interesting to read the pamphlet in Borys’s voice, being so accustomed to the narrative voices of his father – it becomes detached, but remains intimate, and makes for fine reading. 

The very first page, after the contents of course, is concerned with “the second home” Conrad occupied after his marriage – Pent Farm in Postling, near Hythe.  Pent Farm was the former residence of Ford Madox Hueffer, who was there from 1897-1898, and from whom Joseph Conrad and Jessie George took over the tenancy. (Interestingly, at the time of writing, the property is for sale with an asking price of £1,500,000). A beautiful cottage, the lintel of Pent Farm once contained a quotation, reputedly by Walter Crane, which read: 

Want we not for board or tent
While overhead we have the Pent

Borys writes that the quote “remained there until some six or seven years ago [from 1974] when some over-enthusiastic house decorator obliterated the inscription”.   As one will see if they choose to search for the property listing, the “grapevine which grew over it no longer exist[s]”, but despite this, the house has remained almost untouched – inscription and grapevine aside. 

Pent Farm is supposed to be associated with many of Conrad’s key works, such as Youth (1898), The Heart of Darkness (1899), Lord Jim (1900), Typhoon (1902), Nostromo (1904) and The Secret Agent (1907) to say a few. A lesser known work, The End of the Tether (1902) is included later by Borys, as a work which “was partly destroyed by fire when the glass bowl of [his] father’s table lamp burst and set fire to the manuscripts on his writing table”.  Despite this, it would be collected in Youth, A Narrative and Two Other Stories in 1902. 

The author reports that many literary figures visited Pent Farm, including John Galsworthy, H. G. Wells, William Rothstein, Henry James, R. B. Cunningham Graham and numerous others. The family remained at the house until 1907, when Jessie George grew and when the advent of John Conrad “made it necessary to seek a larger house”.
