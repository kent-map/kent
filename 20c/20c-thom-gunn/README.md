“The snail pushes through a green   
night, for the grass is heavy   
with water and meets over   
the bright path he makes, where rain   
has darkened the earth’s dark. He   
moves in a wood of desire…”   
– “Considering the Snail” by Thom Gunn

It’s a few days before Mother’s Day. My Dad and I park at the St. George’s Centre. Our destination is the local Primark to buy some socks. It’s night, and the streetlights illuminate the cobblestone road. To my left, by the St. George’s Church, the cold pierces my jacket. There’s a sculpture of a bug, made out of what I can only imagine to be scrap metal. The kind of stuff you’d see in a tight lane at Cornwall, wooden fence poles being strangled by rusted wire. Inside the bug is a mountain of plastic bottles. I am still confused to this day as to whether it’s affectionate or deeply sardonic.

As we’re walking back to the Centre, I notice a man stumbling out of one of Gravesend’s many dilapidated alleyways, almost tripping up. The pavement we’re walking on gets narrower as a garbage container blocks us. We wait for the man and he mumbles a thanks quietly while my Dad thanks him more loudly. A few weeks later, I am suddenly accosted by a poem by Gunn, from his final book Boss Cupid:

“‘It’s a doggy dog world.’
Charming error.”

Back home, I also remember, Wasn’t Thom Gunn born in Gravesend? I’m sure there’s a memorial of him there. 

There was none. It was like his name became lost to the murky Thames that the town looks over.

This is the subject of this article. Where is Thom Gunn in his hometown, when it seems he doesn’t even exist? Simple, I say, I’ll put him there myself.

Thomson William “Thom” Gunn was born in Gravesend on the 29th of August 1929 and died in Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco, on the 25th of April 2004. He is best known for his AIDS eulogies, particularly expressed in The Man with Night Sweats, first published in 1992. You’d think, just like I did, that Gunn would be a celebrated figure in his hometown. We have a statue of Pocahontas, although everyone skirts around the unintentional dark circumstance that she died there after being effectively stolen from her homeland. Yet Gravesend has no memorial of the queer icon. Although Gunn would personally roll over in his grave to ever be associated with Gravesend, because of the memories it harboured. The divorce of his parents, the suicide of his mother Charlotte, and the apathetic feelings towards his father Herbert are likely factors in his dissociation.

The first poem in Boss Cupid includes the lines:

“[He] went on writing while the Ferry turned
From San Francisco, back from Berkeley too,
And back again, and back again. He learned
You add to, you don't cancel what you do.”

Even though Gunn is strictly speaking of the Bay Area, reading this, standing outside the Three Daws, looking towards the murky Thames and watching all the industrial ships fade into the misty fog as it slowly begins to rain, I cannot help but feel that a little piece of Gravesend followed Gunn into his poetry. The same goes for the poem quoted at the beginning of this article. Yes, he is in America, but he’s also in Gravesend. The number of people I see, the happy loners, disgruntled misfits, the uneven cobblestone roads, the grey centre in front of the Woodville Halls where tarpaulin hangs off barely constructed buildings like dead skin, the train station and the Ballardian car park ahead (I imagine crimson flakes falling from its edges), everywhere I look, there’s something and nothing. Even on a sunny day, Gravesend is blissfully silent and loud, a town stuck in a numbing limbo. Like an art piece from the Dada lot, things just happen around here without much in the way of links to make sense of it.

I first encountered Thom Gunn during my first years at CCCU. “The J Car” presented vivid imagery that was reminiscent of the Kentish countryside:

“Climbing between small yards recessed with vine –
Their ordered privacy, their plots of flowers
Like blameless lives we might imagine ours.
Most trees were cut back, but some brushed the car
Before it swung round to the street once more
On which I rolled out almost to the end…”

A poem, once again, about comradery, seeing them “ride through darkened yards ahead”, reading it now evokes the image of those long stretches of green fields where I’d lain down and felt the grass take over my arms and neck as I watched the orange sun hide its influence beneath the holly bushes. I might be doing Gunn a disservice by going against his unsaid wish to never return nor be linked back to Gravesend. I hope the ghost can forgive me here. Gunn was honoured in 2017 with a bronze bootprint at the San Francisco South of Market Leather History Alley, and, to reiterate, there is no mention of him anywhere in Gravesend, or Kent for that matter.

Why should that stop me or you?

Thom Gunn may have discussed America, but his Elizabethan Britishness never left him. His brash and reserved nature towards his sexuality was inspiring to Bi me. And, despite my rather cynical observations, Gravesend does yield positive memories for me. I remember visiting the Guru Nanak Darbar Gurdwara for the first time when I was in the Cubs Scouts, being introduced to a community who held unification and hospitality to the highest degree, the St. George’s parades I’d participate in, both young and teen, even when it was raining outside the halls, standing beside Windmill Street, the days my family went to the F.S. Steakhouse at Milton Road, and the vibrant Sukhothai. There were also times of inconvenience, such as being taken to the Community Hospital for a greenstick fracture on my arm I gave myself deciding laminated floors were safe to skid on (they’re not).

, Gunn may have left Kent behind, but his words, at least for me, linger around those green gardens that outstretch their reach across the county.
