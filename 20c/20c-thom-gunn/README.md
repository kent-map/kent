“The snail pushes through a green
night, for the grass is heavy
with water and meets over
the bright path he makes, where rain
has darkened the earth’s dark. He
moves in a wood of desire…”
– “Considering the Snail” by Thom Gunn

It’s a few days before Mother’s Day. My Dad and I park at the St. George’s Centre. Our destination is the local Primark to buy some socks. It’s night, and the streetlights illuminate the cobblestone road. To my left, by the St. George’s Church, the cold pierces my jacket. There’s a sculpture of a bug, made out of what I can only imagine to be scrap metal. The kind of stuff you’d see in a tight lane at Cornwall, wooden fence poles being strangled by rusted wire. Inside the bug is a mountain of plastic bottles. I am still confused to this day as to whether it’s either affectionate or deeply sardonic.
