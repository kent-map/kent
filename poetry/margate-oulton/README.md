[Margate](/21c/21c-margate) Beach


I was in a different shelter,

same sands, when gull wings

started strobing the sky.

In 1930 a fictional

blackmailer was stabbed

in a deck chair on this beach -

the clues are scribbled on the sea.

In Dreamland, previously Sanger’s,

(which also features in the book)

a man in yellow is bouncing a ball,

rain taps on the ground

and my baby don’t care.
