I was in a different shelter,   
same sands, when gull wings   
started strobing the sky.   
In 1930 a fictional   
blackmailer was stabbed   
in a deck chair on this beach -   
the clues are scribbled on the sea.   
In Dreamland, previously Sanger’s,   
(which also features in the book)   
a man in yellow is bouncing a ball,   
rain taps on the ground   
and my baby don’t care.
