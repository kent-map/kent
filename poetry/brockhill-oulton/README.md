Brockhill Park, Sunday Afternoon


A few feet away, the child is waiting.

Strands of rain, wind’s pummelling,

salt sun (even a woman, bent

like a pause in conversation)

have left that day intact.


Today the day after that day

means tomorrow. I know at once

this is tomorrow. Grass that is almost

too green to be not quite pink,

a leaf glazed on the mudbank.


Lumpy stones trudge across the stream,

holding my foot as my body

slides like foam, water reaching

for my toes. Another moment -

I am climbing the arch of a tree.


No. Not that.

But I take off my watch,

prod a stick

in the direction of the sea.

Tell no one where I am.
