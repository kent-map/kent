The Fisherman's Bride

The Fisherman’s Bride


[Folkestone Museum](https://www.folkestonemuseum.co.uk/)



Polished light glances off the wood.

The wheel is salvaged always

and lives where possible.

The wreckage makes a collection box.

In time odd pieces float

in to the glass of the museum.


The fisherman’s bride in the corner

wears silk stiff as bones.

Wind and salt are peeling

the skin off the beach.

The fisherman’s bride is dressed

in the colours of the sea.
