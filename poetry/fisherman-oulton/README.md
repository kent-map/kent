Polished light glances off the wood.   
The wheel is salvaged always   
and lives where possible.   
The wreckage makes a collection box.   
In time odd pieces float   
in to the glass of the museum.   

The fisherman’s bride in the corner   
wears silk stiff as bones.   
Wind and salt are peeling   
the skin off the beach.   
The fisherman’s bride is dressed   
in the colours of the sea.
