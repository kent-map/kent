[Hop Picking](/20c/20c-hop-picking)

[Dickens](/dickens) sees bodies wet in the hedges,   
hop dust is believed to cure consumption.   
Eden Phillpotts, writing in 1916,   
starts with sunshine and deft fingered girls.

They were let out early   
for hop picking. Wincheap.   
I’ve got smoke-stained alleys   
and the carpet shop. Like a holiday   
she says, she could go there   
now and see it all again.
