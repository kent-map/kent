[Hop Picking](/20c/20c-hop-picking)


[Dickens](/dickens) sees bodies wet in the hedges,

hop dust is believed to cure consumption.

Eden Phillpotts, writing in 1916,

starts with sunshine and deft fingered girls.

By the 1930s and Orwell it’s blood

all over the fingers and chaff in the throat.


But for Eileen one January morning, hops

nailed to the ceiling brittle as dust,

in the home where she now lives?

Her school at one end of [Canterbury](/20c-canterbury-ww2)

was bombed. I didn’t know

it had a chapel.


They were let out early

for hop picking. Wincheap.

I’ve got smoke-stained alleys

and the carpet shop. Like a holiday

she says, she could go there

now and see it all again.
